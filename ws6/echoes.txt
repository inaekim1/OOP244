Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the airAnd deep beneath the rolling wavesIn labyrinths of coral cavesThe echo of a distant timeComes willowing across the sandAnd everything is green and submarineAnd no one showed us to the landAnd no one knows the wheres or whysBut something stirs and something triesAnd starts to climb towards the lightStrangers passing in the streetBy chance two separate glances meetAnd I am you and what I see is meAnd do I take you by the hand?And lead you through the land?And help me understand the best I can?And no one calls us to move onAnd no one forces down our eyesAnd no one speaks and no one triesAnd no one flies around the sunCloudless everyday you fall upon my waking eyesInviting and inciting me to riseAnd through the window in the wallCome streaming in on sunlight wingsA million bright ambassadors of morningAnd no one sings me lullabiesAnd no one makes me close my eyesAnd so I throw the windows wideAnd call to you across the sky
